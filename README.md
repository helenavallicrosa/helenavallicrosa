HELENA VALLICROSA

I'm passionate about understanding how plant elemental composition can give us clues about plants ecology
and how this information can help us in our knowledge about diversity and climate change.

I'm a postdoc at the Terrer Lab, in the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

I defended my PhD in Terrestrial Ecology in November of 2021, under the supervision of Josep Peñuelas and Jordi Sardans at CREAF, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Spain.
